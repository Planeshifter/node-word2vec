 THE PROLOGUE

 Enter Chorus.


 Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,
 In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
 From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
 Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
 From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
 A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
 Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
 Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
 The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
 And the continuance of their parents' rage,
 Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
 Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
 The which if you with patient ears attend,
 What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
 [Exit.]




 ACT I. Scene I.
 Verona. A public place.

 Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
 of Capulet.


 Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.

 Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.

 Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

 Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.

 Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.

 Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

 Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

 Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
 Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

 Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
 the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

 Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
 wall.

 Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
 are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
 from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.

 Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

 Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
 fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
 their heads.

 Greg. The heads of the maids?

 Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
 Take it in what sense thou wilt.

 Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.

 Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
 am a pretty piece of flesh.

 Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
 been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
 Montagues.

 Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].


 Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.

 Greg. How? turn thy back and run?

 Samp. Fear me not.

 Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!

 Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

 Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.

 Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
 disgrace to them, if they bear it.

 Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

 Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.

 Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

 Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?

 Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.

 Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
 thumb, sir.

 Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?

 Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.

 Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
 you.

 Abr. No better.

 Samp. Well, sir
